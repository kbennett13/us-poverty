us-poverty
==============

This is a visualization of poverty rates by state from 1995 - 2013. The radio buttons on the side allow the user to choose between viewing data for people under 18 (children) and viewing data for people of all ages (all). The slider changes the year. If the user mouses over a state, the postal code and percentage are displayed.

Data from http://www.census.gov/did/www/saipe/downloads/.
